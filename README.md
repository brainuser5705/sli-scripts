# sli-scripts
scripts to make grading easier for me

### File Structure
Here are the main files and their descriptions.

1. `extract.py`
This script extracts the zip file downloaded from myCourses and stores the extracted files (the students' actual submissions into a folder). It then goes into the new folder to extract the students' zip folders into new folders with their name.

2. `tests\<assignment-name>\**<assignment>.py**`
These files are specific for each lab's testing setup. More explanation will be added as I become familiar with the grading procedure in future weeks.
